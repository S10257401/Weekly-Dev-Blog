        <ul>
            <li>Understanding hoisting and how variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of the function or global scope, while variables declared with let and const are not hoisted.</li>
            <li>Learning about the let keyword, which is block-scoped and does not allow redeclaration of variables within the same scope.</li>
            <li>Understanding constants declared with const, which cannot be reassigned after initialization, but their properties can be modified if they are objects.</li>
            <li>Exploring the for...of statement, which iterates over iterable objects such as arrays, maps, sets, strings, and typed arrays, providing a concise way to loop through elements.</li>
            <li>Recap of literal objects, function-based objects, and the usage of the for...of loop.</li>
            <li>Emphasizing the importance of practice and using browser developer tools/debugger for debugging and learning.</li>
        </ul>
