            <ul>
                <li>Lottie is a JSON-based animation file format that enables animations on any platform easily.</li>
                <li>It allows additional interactivity on websites or mobile platforms.</li>
                <li>Lottie files are small, lightweight, and work on any device without pixelation.</li>
                <li>Lottie was first created by AirBnB.</li>
                <li>File size matters: Lottie animations are extremely lightweight because they are essentially code.</li>
                <li>In the Lottie workflow, you work closely with SVG or After Effects.</li>
                <li>Lottie can be imported and used in several platforms, but in your scenario, you are using it for the web version.</li>
                <li>Working with LottieFiles involves finding a suitable animation, importing the JSON code into your HTML file, and optionally using the LottieEditor to modify the animation.</li>
        </ul>
