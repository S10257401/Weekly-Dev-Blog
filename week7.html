            <li>Understanding the concept of the DOM, which represents the hierarchical structure of an HTML document as a tree-like structure, with each element, attribute, and text represented as nodes.</li>
            <li>Introduction to the document node, which represents the entire HTML document, serving as the entry point for accessing other nodes in the DOM tree.</li>
            <li>Learning about element nodes, which correspond to HTML tags and form the backbone of the DOM tree, allowing access to attributes and text nodes within them.</li>
            <li>Exploring attribute nodes, which represent attributes within HTML elements, such as class and id, and understanding how to modify them using JavaScript.</li>
            <li>Understanding text nodes, which contain the textual content within HTML elements, and learning how to access and modify them through JavaScript.</li>
            <li>Overview of accessing, querying, and updating the DOM using JavaScript methods, such as querying for elements, updating attributes, and modifying text content.</li>
